
MusterCull v1.0 - A Bukkit plugin and Minecraft mob limiter.

By Celdecea
Found at https://github.com/Celdecea/MusterCull


WORKING STUFF:

The first mode of operation is called SPAWN. Mobs are limited by number and
range at the point of spawn. If a mob is about to spawn in an area with more
than the configured limit for that type the spawn is canceled. The range to
check is configurable as well.

CONFIGURING:

Put the jar in plugins and create MusterCull/config.yml

Add the following (you don't need START and END lines):
#-- START -------------------------------------
#limits:
CREEPER
#  limit: 20
#  culling: SPAWN
#  range: 100
#-- END ---------------------------------------

Copy the four lines under limits: for each mob you want to cull. Remove the # from
the beginning of each line, including limits:.

The fields are:

type:	The name of the entity to manage culling for. These are taken from Bukkit's
		EntityType enumeration and are case sensitive (so use upper-case):
		
			CREEPER			SKELETON		SPIDER
			ZOMBIE			SLIME			GHAST
			PIGZOMBIE		ENDERMAN		CAVESPIDER
			SILVERFISH		BLAZE			LAVASLIME
			ENDERDRAGON		PIG				SHEEP
			COW				CHICKEN			SQUID
			WOLF			MUSHROOMCOW		SNOWMAN
			OZELOT			VILLAGERGOLEM	VILLAGER

limit:  The hard number of mobs of this type to limit in a certain area. If this is
		zero or less, all mobs are culled.

culling:	The method to use for culling the mob. Currently only two methods exist,
			SPAWN and DAMAGE.

				SPAWN		Prevents mobs from spawning using a Bukkit event listener.

				DAMAGE		Chunks with too many mobs of a certain type begin dealing
							damage to random mobs.

range:	The distance from the mob to check. If this value is zero or less, no checking
		is performed and cycles are wasted, so comment out unused limits from this file.


IN PROGRESS STUFF:

The second mode of operation, called CLUSTER, involves detecting saturated
areas and dealing with the over population of mobs.

As mobs are added or loaded, the engine will check to see if they are about
to spawn in a saturated area. If so, the engine will randomly pick nearby
equivalent mobs to start damaging. A mob being damaged will continue to be
damaged until dead or levels drop back to normal. Furthermore, the mob will
look for another over-populated mob to begin damaging (up to a limit).

Players can either quickly move animals out of the area, use potions, or
manually cull their animals to stop the damage.


PLANNED STUFF:

Commands to do some of this stuff live and manipulate the configs and some
way to configure notifications.
