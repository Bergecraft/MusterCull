
MusterCull v1.0 - A Bukkit plugin and a better Minecraft mob limiter.

WORKING STUFF:

The first mode of operation is called SPAWN. Mobs are limited by number and
range at the point of spawn. If a mob is about to spawn in an area with more
than the configured limit for that type the spawn is canceled. The range to
check is configurable as well.


IN PROGRESS STUFF:

The second mode of operation, called CLUSTER, involves detecting saturated
areas and dealing with the overpopulation of mobs.

As mobs are added or loaded, the engine will check to see if they are about
to spawn in a saturated area. If so, the engine will randomly pick nearby
equivalent mobs to start damaging. A mob being damaged will continue to be
damaged until dead or levels drop back to normal. Furthermore, the mob will
look for another over-populated mob to begin damaging (up to a limit).

Players can either quickly move animals out of the area, use potions, or
manually cull their animals to stop the damage.


PLANNED STUFF:

Commands to do some of this stuff live and manipulate the configs and some
way to configure notifications.
