
MusterCull v1.0 - A Bukkit plugin and Minecraft mob limiter.

DESCRIPTION:

This mod allows mobs to be culled using one of two methods. The first method
blocks mobs from spawning if there are already too many of that type in a
configurable range. The second method randomly damages mobs if they are in
an area with too many of that type.

Spawn culling is useful for hostile mobs, spawners and grinders while damage
culling is useful for persistent mobs like farm animals.

CONFIGURING:

Put the jar in plugins and create MusterCull/config.yml

Add the following (you don't need START and END lines):
#-- START -------------------------------------
#limits:
#- type: CREEPER
#  limit: 20
#  culling: SPAWN
#  range: 100
#-- END ---------------------------------------

Copy the four lines under limits: for each mob you want to cull. Remove the # from
the beginning of each line, including limits:.

The fields are:

type:	The name of the entity to manage culling for. These are taken from Bukkit's
		EntityType enumeration and are case sensitive (so use upper-case):
		
			CREEPER			SKELETON		SPIDER
			ZOMBIE			SLIME			GHAST
			PIGZOMBIE		ENDERMAN		CAVESPIDER
			SILVERFISH		BLAZE			LAVASLIME
			ENDERDRAGON		PIG				SHEEP
			COW				CHICKEN			SQUID
			WOLF			MUSHROOMCOW		SNOWMAN
			OZELOT			VILLAGERGOLEM	VILLAGER

limit:  The hard number of mobs of this type to limit in a certain area. If this is
		zero or less, all mobs are culled.

culling:	The method to use for culling the mob. Currently only two methods exist,
			SPAWN and DAMAGE.

				SPAWN		Prevents mobs from spawning using a Bukkit event listener.
							If a mob tries to spawn over the limit it is blocked.

				DAMAGE		Mobs are damaged if crowded. A timed event damages mobs on
							an interval if they are in an area with too many of that
							type.

range:	The distance from the mob to check. If this value is zero or less, no checking
		is performed and cycles are wasted, so comment out unused limits from this file.


PLANNED STUFF:

Commands to do some of this stuff live and manipulate the configs and some
way to configure notifications.
